# Calculator-for-Electronic-

The topic of my project was to design a simple calculator for electronics and computer scientists with specific functionality 
outlined in the task instructions, which included the ability to switch between number systems such as binary, hexadecimal, octal, 
and floating-point.The project consists of:

Division into class systems and functions that implement the calculator's operations.
A simple command-line interface for the user.
The entire project was developed using Visual Studio 2019 for the Windows operating system.
